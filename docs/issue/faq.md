> Why are ++ and -- statements and not expressions? And why postfix, not prefix?

```
Without pointer arithmetic, the convenience value of pre- and postfix increment operators drops. By removing them from the expression hierarchy altogether, expression syntax is simplified and the messy issues around order of evaluation of ++ and -- (consider f(i++) and p[i] = q[++i]) are eliminated as well. The simplification is significant. As for postfix vs. prefix, either would work fine but the postfix version is more traditional; insistence on prefix arose with the STL, a library for a language whose name contains, ironically, a postfix increment.
```

> Why is there no pointer arithmetic?

```
Safety. Without pointer arithmetic it's possible to create a language that can never derive an illegal address that succeeds incorrectly. Compiler and hardware technology have advanced to the point where a loop using array indices can be as efficient as a loop using pointer arithmetic. Also, the lack of pointer arithmetic can simplify the implementation of the garbage collector.
```

> Why are declarations backwards?

```
They're only backwards if you're used to C. In C, the notion is that a variable is declared like an expression denoting its type, which is a nice idea, but the type and expression grammars don't mix very well and the results can be confusing; consider function pointers. Go mostly separates expression and type syntax and that simplifies things (using prefix * for pointers is an exception that proves the rule). In C, the declaration

    int* a, b;
declares a to be a pointer but not b; in Go

    var a, b *int
declares both to be pointers. This is clearer and more regular. Also, the := short declaration form argues that a full variable declaration should present the same order as := so

    var a uint64 = 1
has the same effect as

    a := uint64(1)
Parsing is also simplified by having a distinct grammar for types that is not just the expression grammar; keywords such as func and chan keep things clear.

See the article about Go's Declaration Syntax for more details.

> Why are maps, slices, and channels references while arrays are values?

```go
There's a lot of history on that topic. Early on, maps and channels were syntactically pointers and it was impossible to declare or use a non-pointer instance. Also, we struggled with how arrays should work. Eventually we decided that the strict separation of pointers and values made the language harder to use. Changing these types to act as references to the associated, shared data structures resolved these issues. This change added some regrettable complexity to the language but had a large effect on usability: Go became a more productive, comfortable language when it was introduced.
```

> Why don't maps allow slices as keys?

```
Map lookup requires an equality operator, which slices do not implement. They don't implement equality because equality is not well defined on such types; there are multiple considerations involving shallow vs. deep comparison, pointer vs. value comparison, how to deal with recursive types, and so on. We may revisit this issue—and implementing equality for slices will not invalidate any existing programs—but without a clear idea of what equality of slices should mean, it was simpler to leave it out for now.

In Go 1, unlike prior releases, equality is defined for structs and arrays, so such types can be used as map keys. Slices still do not have a definition of equality, though.
```

> Why are maps built in?

```
The same reason strings are: they are such a powerful and important data structure that providing one excellent implementation with syntactic support makes programming more pleasant. We believe that Go's implementation of maps is strong enough that it will serve for the vast majority of uses. If a specific application can benefit from a custom implementation, it's possible to write one but it will not be as convenient syntactically; this seems a reasonable tradeoff.
```

> How do constants work in Go?

```
Although Go is strict about conversion between variables of different numeric types, constants in the language are much more flexible. Literal constants such as 23, 3.14159 and math.Pi occupy a sort of ideal number space, with arbitrary precision and no overflow or underflow. For instance, the value of math.Pi is specified to 63 places in the source code, and constant expressions involving the value keep precision beyond what a float64 could hold. Only when the constant or constant expression is assigned to a variable—a memory location in the program—does it become a "computer" number with the usual floating-point properties and precision.

Also, because they are just numbers, not typed values, constants in Go can be used more freely than variables, thereby softening some of the awkwardness around the strict conversion rules. One can write expressions such as

sqrt2 := math.Sqrt(2)
without complaint from the compiler because the ideal number 2 can be converted safely and accurately to a float64 for the call to math.Sqrt.

A blog post titled Constants explores this topic in more detail.
```

> Why does Go not provide implicit numeric conversions?

```
The convenience of automatic conversion between numeric types in C is outweighed by the confusion it causes. When is an expression unsigned? How big is the value? Does it overflow? Is the result portable, independent of the machine on which it executes? It also complicates the compiler; “the usual arithmetic conversions” are not easy to implement and inconsistent across architectures. For reasons of portability, we decided to make things clear and straightforward at the cost of some explicit conversions in the code. The definition of constants in Go—arbitrary precision values free of signedness and size annotations—ameliorates matters considerably, though.

A related detail is that, unlike in C, int and int64 are distinct types even if int is a 64-bit type. The int type is generic; if you care about how many bits an integer holds, Go encourages you to be explicit.
```

> Why does Go not have covariant result types?

```
Covariant result types would mean that an interface like

type Copyable interface {
    Copy() interface{}
}
would be satisfied by the method

func (v Value) Copy() Value
because Value implements the empty interface. In Go method types must match exactly, so Value does not implement Copyable. Go separates the notion of what a type does—its methods—from the type's implementation. If two methods return different types, they are not doing the same thing. Programmers who want covariant result types are often trying to express a type hierarchy through interfaces. In Go it's more natural to have a clean separation between interface and implementation.
```

> Why is my nil error value not equal to nil?

```
Under the covers, interfaces are implemented as two elements, a type T and a value V. V is a concrete value such as an int, struct or pointer, never an interface itself, and has type T. For instance, if we store the int value 3 in an interface, the resulting interface value has, schematically, (T=int, V=3). The value V is also known as the interface's dynamic value, since a given interface variable might hold different values V (and corresponding types T) during the execution of the program.

An interface value is nil only if the V and T are both unset, (T=nil, V is not set), In particular, a nil interface will always hold a nil type. If we store a nil pointer of type *int inside an interface value, the inner type will be *int regardless of the value of the pointer: (T=*int, V=nil). Such an interface value will therefore be non-nil even when the pointer value V inside is nil.

This situation can be confusing, and arises when a nil value is stored inside an interface value such as an error return:

func returnsError() error {
    var p *MyError = nil
    if bad() {
        p = ErrBad
    }
    return p // Will always return a non-nil error.
}
If all goes well, the function returns a nil p, so the return value is an error interface value holding (T=*MyError, V=nil). This means that if the caller compares the returned error to nil, it will always look as if there was an error even if nothing bad happened. To return a proper nil error to the caller, the function must return an explicit nil:

func returnsError() error {
    if bad() {
        return ErrBad
    }
    return nil
}
It's a good idea for functions that return errors always to use the error type in their signature (as we did above) rather than a concrete type such as *MyError, to help guarantee the error is created correctly. As an example, os.Open returns an error even though, if not nil, it's always of concrete type *os.PathError.

Similar situations to those described here can arise whenever interfaces are used. Just keep in mind that if any concrete value has been stored in the interface, the interface will not be nil. For more information, see The Laws of Reflection.
```

> Why doesn't Go have "implements" declarations?

```
A Go type satisfies an interface by implementing the methods of that interface, nothing more. This property allows interfaces to be defined and used without needing to modify existing code. It enables a kind of structural typing that promotes separation of concerns and improves code re-use, and makes it easier to build on patterns that emerge as the code develops. The semantics of interfaces is one of the main reasons for Go's nimble, lightweight feel.

See the question on type inheritance for more detail.
```

> Why does Go not support overloading of methods and operators?

```
Method dispatch is simplified if it doesn't need to do type matching as well. Experience with other languages told us that having a variety of methods with the same name but different signatures was occasionally useful but that it could also be confusing and fragile in practice. Matching only by name and requiring consistency in the types was a major simplifying decision in Go's type system.

Regarding operator overloading, it seems more a convenience than an absolute requirement. Again, things are simpler without it.
```

> Why is len a function and not a method?

```
We debated this issue but decided implementing len and friends as functions was fine in practice and didn't complicate questions about the interface (in the Go type sense) of basic types.
```


> Why is there no type inheritance?

```go
Object-oriented programming, at least in the best-known languages, involves too much discussion of the relationships between types, relationships that often could be derived automatically. Go takes a different approach.

Rather than requiring the programmer to declare ahead of time that two types are related, in Go a type automatically satisfies any interface that specifies a subset of its methods. Besides reducing the bookkeeping, this approach has real advantages. Types can satisfy many interfaces at once, without the complexities of traditional multiple inheritance. Interfaces can be very lightweight—an interface with one or even zero methods can express a useful concept. Interfaces can be added after the fact if a new idea comes along or for testing—without annotating the original types. Because there are no explicit relationships between types and interfaces, there is no type hierarchy to manage or discuss.

It's possible to use these ideas to construct something analogous to type-safe Unix pipes. For instance, see how fmt.Fprintf enables formatted printing to any output, not just a file, or how the bufio package can be completely separate from file I/O, or how the image packages generate compressed image files. All these ideas stem from a single interface (io.Writer) representing a single method (Write). And that's only scratching the surface. Go's interfaces have a profound influence on how programs are structured.

It takes some getting used to but this implicit style of type dependency is one of the most productive things about Go.
```

> How do I get dynamic dispatch of methods?

```
The only way to have dynamically dispatched methods is through an interface. Methods on a struct or any other concrete type are always resolved statically.
```

> Is Go an object-oriented language?

```
Yes and no. Although Go has types and methods and allows an object-oriented style of programming, there is no type hierarchy. The concept of “interface” in Go provides a different approach that we believe is easy to use and in some ways more general. There are also ways to embed types in other types to provide something analogous—but not identical—to subclassing. Moreover, methods in Go are more general than in C++ or Java: they can be defined for any sort of data, even built-in types such as plain, “unboxed” integers. They are not restricted to structs (classes).

Also, the lack of a type hierarchy makes “objects” in Go feel much more lightweight than in languages such as C++ or Java.
```

> Why are map operations not defined to be atomic?

```go
After long discussion it was decided that the typical use of maps did not require safe access from multiple goroutines, and in those cases where it did, the map was probably part of some larger data structure or computation that was already synchronized. Therefore requiring that all map operations grab a mutex would slow down most programs and add safety to few. This was not an easy decision, however, since it means uncontrolled map access can crash the program.

The language does not preclude atomic map updates. When required, such as when hosting an untrusted program, the implementation could interlock map access.

Map access is unsafe only when updates are occurring. As long as all goroutines are only reading—looking up elements in the map, including iterating through it using a for range loop—and not changing the map by assigning to elements or doing deletions, it is safe for them to access the map concurrently without synchronization.

As an aid to correct map use, some implementations of the language contain a special check that automatically reports at run time when a map is modified unsafely by concurrent execution.
```

> Why does Go not have assertions?

```go
Go doesn't provide assertions. They are undeniably convenient, but our experience has been that programmers use them as a crutch to avoid thinking about proper error handling and reporting. Proper error handling means that servers continue to operate instead of crashing after a non-fatal error. Proper error reporting means that errors are direct and to the point, saving the programmer from interpreting a large crash trace. Precise errors are particularly important when the programmer seeing the errors is not familiar with the code.

We understand that this is a point of contention. There are many things in the Go language and libraries that differ from modern practices, simply because we feel it's sometimes worth trying a different approach.
```

> Why does Go not have exceptions?

```
We believe that coupling exceptions to a control structure, as in the try-catch-finally idiom, results in convoluted code. It also tends to encourage programmers to label too many ordinary errors, such as failing to open a file, as exceptional.

Go takes a different approach. For plain error handling, Go's multi-value returns make it easy to report an error without overloading the return value. A canonical error type, coupled with Go's other features, makes error handling pleasant but quite different from that in other languages.

Go also has a couple of built-in functions to signal and recover from truly exceptional conditions. The recovery mechanism is executed only as part of a function's state being torn down after an error, which is sufficient to handle catastrophe but requires no extra control structures and, when used well, can result in clean error-handling code.

See the Defer, Panic, and Recover article for details. Also, the Errors are values blog post describes one approach to handling errors cleanly in Go by demonstrating that, since errors are just values, the full power of Go can deployed in error handling.
```

> Why does Go not have generic types?

```
Generics may well be added at some point. We don't feel an urgency for them, although we understand some programmers do.

Go was intended as a language for writing server programs that would be easy to maintain over time. (See this article for more background.) The design concentrated on things like scalability, readability, and concurrency. Polymorphic programming did not seem essential to the language's goals at the time, and so was left out for simplicity.

The language is more mature now, and there is scope to consider some form of generic programming. However, there remain some caveats.

Generics are convenient but they come at a cost in complexity in the type system and run-time. We haven't yet found a design that gives value proportionate to the complexity, although we continue to think about it. Meanwhile, Go's built-in maps and slices, plus the ability to use the empty interface to construct containers (with explicit unboxing) mean in many cases it is possible to write code that does what generics would enable, if less smoothly.

The topic remains open. For a look at several previous unsuccessful attempts to design a good generics solution for Go, see this proposal.
```

> What are the guiding principles in the design?

```go
When Go was designed, Java and C++ were the most commonly used languages for writing servers, at least at Google. We felt that these languages required too much bookkeeping and repetition. Some programmers reacted by moving towards more dynamic, fluid languages like Python, at the cost of efficiency and type safety. We felt it should be possible to have the efficiency, the safety, and the fluidity in a single language.

Go attempts to reduce the amount of typing in both senses of the word. Throughout its design, we have tried to reduce clutter and complexity. There are no forward declarations and no header files; everything is declared exactly once. Initialization is expressive, automatic, and easy to use. Syntax is clean and light on keywords. Stuttering (foo.Foo* myFoo = new(foo.Foo)) is reduced by simple type derivation using the := declare-and-initialize construct. And perhaps most radically, there is no type hierarchy: types just are, they don't have to announce their relationships. These simplifications allow Go to be expressive yet comprehensible without sacrificing, well, sophistication.

Another important principle is to keep the concepts orthogonal. Methods can be implemented for any type; structures represent data while interfaces represent abstraction; and so on. Orthogonality makes it easier to understand what happens when things combine.
```

> What are Go's ancestors?

```go
Go is mostly in the C family (basic syntax), with significant input from the Pascal/Modula/Oberon family (declarations, packages), plus some ideas from languages inspired by Tony Hoare's CSP, such as Newsqueak and Limbo (concurrency). However, it is a new language across the board. In every respect the language was designed by thinking about what programmers do and how to make programming, at least the kind of programming we do, more effective, which means more fun.
